It has been more than 4 days, and despite multiple follow-ups with customer care, there is zero resolution.\n\nThis is extremely frustrating and unprofessional. Taking payment is instant, but activating the account or providing proper support seems impossible for them. Customer care keeps giving false assurances with no actual action.\n\nThis feels like a complete waste of money and time. If you cannot activate accounts after receiving payment, you should not be selling subscriptions in the first place. Very poor service, no accountability, and terrible customer support.\n\nI do NOT recommend this service to anyone.",

The button animation/indicator does not give a proper forward effect, leading to a poor user experience.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tOpen the application on iPhone 11.\n\t2.\tPlay any video.\n\t3.\tTap the 10s forward button.\n\nExpected Result:\nThe video should move forward by 10 seconds and the UI should clearly indicate the forward action.\n\nActual Result:\nThe forward action is performed, but the UI is visually unclear and does not provide proper feedback.\n\nSeverity: Low\nPriority: Medium\n\n⸻\n\nDefect ID: D-002\n\nTitle: Unable to forward video beyond 20 seconds; background stream continues\nDescription:\nWhen attempting to forward a video for more than 20 seconds, the stream does not behave as expected. Instead of resuming from the forwarded position (e.g., +10s from current timestamp), the video continues streaming in the background. This creates confusion as playback behavior is inconsistent. Issue has been observed repeatedly over the past few months.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tOpen the application on iPhone 11.\n\t2.\tPlay any video.\n\t3.\tContinuously tap the forward button to skip more than 20 seconds.\n\nExpected Result:\nThe video should pause streaming and resume from the new forwarded timestamp.\n\nActual Result:\nThe video continues to stream in the background without resuming properly from the forwarded position.\n\nSeverity: High\nPriority: High\n\n⸻\n\nDefect ID: D-003\n\nTitle: Rewind/Forward buttons become disabled after multiple clicks; stream continues in background\nDescription:\nWhen attempting to rewind a video to an earlier timestamp (e.g., from 17:40 back to 16:20), the rewind and forward buttons become disabled after 2 clicks. Although the video stream continues to play in the background, the user loses control over navigation, causing confusion.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tOpen the application on iPhone 11.\n\t2.\tPlay a video and go to a later point (e.g., 17:40).\n\t3.\tAttempt to rewind back to 16:20 by clicking the rewind button multiple times.\n\nExpected Result:\nThe video should rewind smoothly to the selected timestamp, and controls should remain active.\n\nActual Result:\nAfter 2 clicks, the rewind/forward buttons become disabled while the video continues streaming in the background.\n\nSeverity: High\nPriority: High\n\n⸻\n\nDefect ID: D-004\n\nTitle: Application response time is laggy during video playback\nDescription:\nThe application shows noticeable lag while playing videos. The response time for user actions (play, pause, forward, rewind) is delayed, leading to an unsmooth playback experience.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\t1.\tOpen the application on iPhone 11.\n\t2.\tPlay any video.\n\t3.\tInteract with playback controls (play, pause, forward, rewind).\n\nExpected Result:\nThe application should respond instantly to user actions, providing smooth playback.\n\nActual Result:\nThe application is slow to respond, resulting in lag and poor user experience.\n\nSeverity: High\nPriority: High",

You are advertising 100% telugu or tamil but this is not working after this forced update. Always showing high traffic for support. Are anyone there to support this issue. Hey where is my watch history man all are cleared? Disgusting. I have paid for the subscription right but why you cleared all history and showing both language content",

For example, I want to watch Kdrama but your search bar result doesn’t even list any kdrama. Instead, I have to randomly click on a kdrama and see the “More like this” listing. Seriously, please do something about it.  Your search bar is defunct and useless. Pay monthly  subscription of RM30 for non-functioning app which is frustrating to use.",

Once you open a channel to watch, you can only press up to choose the language/subtitle. But you have to do it each time you watch a new show. The app doesn’t save your preference of what language/subtitle you choose which is a hassle.\n\n2. The options while watching a tv channel can be better. Instead of pressing the channel to go back and choose different channels, why not make the scroll button open up a selection of options i.e\n- down to open up selection of channels in simple list(like old unifi tv app or the blue button on white hypptv box)\n- up to open language/subtitle settings\n- ok button to open the current channel info (channel name, description, time slot etc like simple info list.\n\nHope to see more improvements going forward for unifi.",

You can’t really watch anything that’s live without it going into the break commercial pause that takes forever to come back then when it does it doesn’t even last not even 5 minutes when it’s back to it again.. This need to be fixed & improved way better since it’s annoying having to exit it out of the app refresh it & go back in & repeatedly have to keep doing it over & over! Not a happy camper as how this is being set up when there’s others app’s that work way better & properly then this one!!",

            "text": "What’s the point of this app?! If you have cable or satellite you can record shows/novelas and watch on your own time and skip ads thru your provider, so you don’t ‘need’ this app. But if you don’t have cable or satellite, you need this app, and it COULD allow you to watch your fave shows/novelas and force you to watch ads… BUT THEY DON’T. Instead, this is a cable/satellite subscribers only app, even tho this channel is free on antenna. MAKES NO SENSE. Definitely not paying to watch novelas like on the NOW app they offer. If they want to make it hard for me to watch their novelas, then I guess I didn’t need to waste my time watching them in the first place. HUGE missed opportunity to get or keep viewers, as well as exposure to your advertisers.",

I’ve troubleshooted, internet connection is solid. Can’t figure out what the heck is going on. My other apps don’t have that issue. Commercials are excessive and annoying.

After a week of watching the same commercial literally repeat five or six times during each episode of my shows, I finally decided to subscribe to Univision NOW. Imagine my surprise after agreeing to pay $12 a month, when the same ad started appearing! What am I paying for? Tried to find a fix but there is no customer service contact, just a few unrelated articles in the so-called help center. I’m definitely unsubscribing.",

Also they do not let you delete your credit card information from the platform. Make sure you go through the live chat option to get your account canceled & save the conversation. Requested my account to be fully deleted alongside an email showing all my information has been removed from their platform. What a disaster app this has been. Ps there’s a lag time of about 3-4 minutes between regular antenna & the app. Just pay $32 for a satellite antenna n watch for free. Paying $11.99 a month for this channel is not worth it.

Thanks for years of bad service Univision you've really made my choice an easy one at the of the day.",

Cuando entro a continuar un capítulo que dejé a la mitad, me aparecen cuatro anuncios y los veo sin problema, pero después de apenas 30 segundos de reproducción vuelven a ponerme otros tres o cuatro más. Esto resulta muy frustrante, ya que ha pasado muy poco tiempo desde que vi los anuncios como para tener que verlos nuevamente.\n\nAdemás, en algunas ocasiones sucede algo más molesto: la aplicación indica cuántos anuncios debo ver. Por ejemplo, me aparece que tengo que ver tres anuncios, los veo completos y, justo al terminar, vuelve a salir que debo ver otros tres anuncios otra vez, cuando se supone que ya los he visto.\n\nTodo esto termina arruinando la experiencia de quienes solo queremos disfrutar un capítulo sin tantas interrupciones. Entiendo la publicidad, pero deberían mejorar la frecuencia con la que aparecen los anuncios.",

Si por algo interrumpes lo que estabas viendo tienes que volver a ver el capítulo desde el inicio por no puedes regresar a verla donde te quedaste.

It’s very complicated to skip scenes, and when I’ve tried using AirPlay or mirroring my phone, it gets stuck. When it freezes and I try closing and reopening it, it doesn’t resume where I left off but starts from the beginning. It could be a good app, but it’s missing basic features. I’ve spent over two hours just trying to watch the first episode because it keeps freezing. Plus, having seven commercials every two minutes is really annoying.",

The only way to fix it is to close the app and restart, but after a few seconds, it happens again. It’s such a hassle. Whoever designed this is incompetent. It’s the same issue on both the iPhone and iPad apps. Meanwhile, the Pilipinas Live app doesn’t have this problem but that one doesn’t support PiP.",
